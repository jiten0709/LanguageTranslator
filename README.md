### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- A modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (e.g., Google Chrome).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jiten0709/LanguageTranslator.git
    cd LanguageTranslator
    ```

2.  **Create a env file in backend dir**

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Update the config.js file in frontend/public dir accordingly**

4.  **Set up and run the backend server:**
    Open a terminal window and run:

    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    node api.js
    ```

    The backend server will start, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

5.  **Set up and run the frontend:**
    Open a **new** terminal window and run:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    This will usually open the application automatically in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Select the source language (the language you are translating from).
3.  Select the target language (the language you want to translate to).
4.  **For text input**: Type your text into the left-hand text area. The translation will appear on the right.
5.  **For speech input**: Click the microphone icon, grant microphone permissions if prompted, and start speaking. Your speech will be converted to text and translated.
